-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run (Easy Mode)
------------------
Download and install the provided APK file in the /build directory.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build src (Hard Mode)
------------------------
  Search for and install "Droidscript" from the Google Play Store (Free),
  and paste the entire XTK folder into the Droidscript project directory.
  Then when you boot the Droidscript app up, it should show up on your
  list of applications.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:   If you have trouble with that folder, there is a file in the
        build directory that is named "DroidXTK.spk", which is a format
        that if you open it with the Droidscript app (in Android), it
        should automatically install the project to the Droidscript
        project directory as well as the above method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Note --> The Droidscript app recognizes apps if either an
html or js file exists in the folder, that matches
the EXACT name of the folder.

        Ex:
             Dir -> /sdcard/Droidscript/MyAppName/
        Filename -> /sdcard/Droidscript/MyAppName/MyAppName.js
                    (or)
                   /sdcard/Droidscript/MyAppName/MyAppName.html
