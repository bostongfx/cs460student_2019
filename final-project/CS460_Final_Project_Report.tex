     DroidXTK is an Android application and framework, of which provides a bridge (in JavaScript) to all the Android API's, for use with the \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{http://www.goxtk.com}{XTK framework}}. The Android app is built using the JavaScript platform \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{http://www.androidscript.org}{Droidscript}}. Some API "features" implemented include: Button/Slider input, Voice Recognition, Sensor i/o, and many more potential possibilities. The main concept will be to create generalized methods, of which can be used (as is) or easily be extended to provide new functionality in the future.

    \section{Introduction}
    Using a webview container, you can modify the contents of a page easily via a console. Using an Android framework called Droidscript, you can execute custom-made codes in a webview that has the XTK framework loaded into it.
    
    
    
    \vspace{0.09 cm}
    \textbf{Scripting Engine:}
    
    The DroidScript App contains a scripting engine which allows anyone with a bit of JavaScript knowledge to easily write Apps for their mobile phone or tablet. You can write very simple Apps with just a few buttons, or more complex ones which include dynamic graphical interfaces such as the DroidScript application itself, which is written using the very same engine.
    
    As well as creating graphical interfaces, you have access to Sensors like the Accelerometer, Compass, Light meter or other device components like Wifi, Bluetooth, Camera, GPS, SD Card, SMS, Emails, Internet and more. We're always adding new functionality to the engine, so if you want something added just let us know via email or leave a comment on the forum.

    \section{Method}
    
    \textbf{App Object:}
    
    \vspace{0.09 cm}
    The \textbf{app} object is the main driving force behind Droidscript and its easy-to-use JavaScript app development framework. Some of the categories of what the app object extends to include:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Application Control
    \item Application Information
    \item Bluetooth
    \item Components
    \item Controls
    \item Cross-Application
    \item Database
    \item Debugging
    \item Device Control
    \item Device Information
    \item Dialogs
    \item Files
    \item Graphics
    \item Layouts
    \item Messaging
    \item Network
    \item Sounds
    \item UI Control
    \item User Information
    \end{itemize}

    Executes JavaScript code on live HTML/JavaScript, in an Android webview container. XTK code bridge created in JavaScript to using Droidscript framework to develop methods.

    \textbf{Android Controls: }
    
    \begin{minted}{javascript}

    \section{Results}
    
    \vspace{0.09 cm}
    
    \textbf{XTK Bridge Method:}
    
    \begin{minted}{javascript}
    function dsx()
    {
    dsx.objectsarray = [];
    var objlst = [];
    //create new xtk obj counter
    this.counter = function (name)
    {
    //counter name
    var cname = "counter_" + name
    //counter as new variable (integer counter)
    this.cnt = cname;
    //set count to 0
    cname = 0;
    //return counter object
    return cname;
    }
    this.cube = function (name, x, y, z, r, g, b)
    {
    dsx.setobj(name, x, y, z, r, g, b);
    var code = ""
    code += (name + " = new X.cube(); \n ")
    code += (name + ".center" + " = 
    [" + x + "," + y + "," + z + "]; \n ")
    code += (name + ".color" + " = 
    [" + r + "," + g + "," + b + " ]; \n ")
    code += ("r.add( " + name + "); \n ")
    code += ("r.render(); \n ");
    return code;
    }
    
    ...
    
    this.getobjlst = function ()
    {
    return dsx.objectsarray;
    }
    
    ...
    
    dsx.writeAsJson = function (path, obj)
    {
    app.WriteFile(path, JSON.stringify(obj));
    }
    
    dsx.readAsJson = function (path)
    {
    if (app.FileExists(path))
    {
    return JSON.parse(app.ReadFile(path));
    }
    app.ShowPopup(path + " does not exist");
    return undefined;
    }
    
    ...
    \end{minted}
    
    \section{Conclusions}
    Had a great working prototype app, that could create several different geometry types, of which you could track their properties, change them, and create additional ones through use of my main xtk() method. The bridge created through my methods, enabled relatively unbounded access to the Android API's and frameworks, allowing them to exchange data back and forth efficiently.
