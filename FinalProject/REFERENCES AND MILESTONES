Replacement of Dat.GUI
////////
Initially attempted to utilize Dat.GUI from Assignment 05 to 09.
Problem A ): Dat.Gui has strange limitations & complications 
& also wanted to experiment with different GUIs
Problem B ): How do we parse information from GUI to the object prototype?

Solution: Jonathan Coleâ€™s Guify


Positioning of Days
///////////////////

Problem A ): Where does the cubes stand on the plane?
Solution A ): day_pos = [-710, -460, -210, 40, 290, 540, 790];


Dimentions of a time cube
/////////////////////////
Problem B ): What are the dimensions of a cube?
Solution B ): Length, Height, Width
Length, Width = 120;
Height = Duration, The time it takes for an Activity [In Mins]

Dealing with 3d textgeometry
/////////////////
Problem A ): How do I know which day is which?
Solution A ): 3D Text! 

Problem B ): How do I go about doing that?
Solution B ): IDK, Google!

Dealing with FontLoader and facetypes.js
/////////////////////

Dealing with duration selection
/////////////////
var duration = [], i, j;
        for(i=0; i<24; i++) {
          for(j=0; j<4; j++) {
            duration.push(i + ":" + (j===0 ? "00" : 15*j) );
          };
        };
		
		
Selection of appropriate days via selection
////////////
Chosen_Time = day_pos[days_name.indexOf(day_Selection)];


Cube won't start in the correct position, may causing clipping to the floorplane
////////////
creation of testcubes to experiment
Turns out, the floorplane's position was offset
We can then determine the actual offset, 
since the origin is in the center of any cube, we can offset exactly half, 
which is the distance from origin to the bottom.
the true offset for the position is then 
this.cubeSize/2 + this.min_height
where, this.min_height = MinInDay - End_Act;

Time selected now goes from top to bottom
//////////
this.max_height = MinInDay - Start_Act;
this.min_height = MinInDay - End_Act;

where, var MinInDay = 1440;



Contingencies
//////////
if color was ever null, randomize color
